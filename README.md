# React TodoMVC
> TodoMVC in modern React with React Router and Immutable.

This is a complete rewrite of the React [example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react) on [TodoMVC.com](http://todomvc.com) primarily using ES2015 with some experimental features.  

The `utils.js` and `todoModel.js` files have been removed and their logic has been moved into the `<TodoApp />` container component.  

Instead of three large components, the app has been broken up into smaller, stateless components.  

All application state lives in the `<App />` component. The two Form components, `<TodoForm />` and `<TodoEditForm />`, are [controlled components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) (they manage the state of their input forms).  

Routing is handled by [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router), instead of the original [Director](https://github.com/flatiron/director) package.  

v4 UUIDs for the todos are generated by the [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package.  

All props are type-checked using [PropTypes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).  

[Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) is used to prevent accidental data mutations and for its robust API for getting and setting data.
